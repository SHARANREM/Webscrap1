# 🎃 PAN India Web Scraping Challenge 2025

## 🚀 **Revolutionizing Result Access for Madras University Students!**

Welcome to our project for the **PAN India Web Scraping Challenge 2025!** We’ve built a **powerful yet simple web app** that enables students to fetch their results seamlessly—whether **one at a time or in bulk.** Unlike conventional methods, our approach **directly accesses Madras University’s official data**, making the result-fetching process **faster, more reliable, and hassle-free.**

---
## 🔥 **Why This Project Stands Out?**
✅ **Real-Time Access** – Fetches results directly from **Madras University’s database** 💡
✅ **Bulk Processing** – Upload a CSV/Excel file & get results for multiple students instantly 📊
✅ **Sleek & Responsive UI** – Built with **Bootstrap & Flask**, ensuring a smooth user experience 🎨
✅ **Fast & Secure** – Backend powered by **Flask & Requests**, ensuring seamless data retrieval 🔒
✅ **Deployed & Live!** – No need for local setup—just use our **hosted web app** 🌍
